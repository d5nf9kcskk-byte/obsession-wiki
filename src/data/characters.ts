    title: 'Characters Expansion Overview',
    content: `The Characters expansion introduces true worker placement mechanics through special character cards, Distinguished Family Members who replace ordinary family cards, Second Chance Servants with powerful abilities and consequences, and a new cooperative challenge.

This expansion fundamentally expands the strategic depth of Obsession without replacing any core mechanics, making it suitable for players who are comfortable with the base game.`,

    id: 'chars-worker-placement',
    expansion: 'characters',
    title: 'Worker Placement Characters',
    content: `The Characters expansion introduces four special cards that function as true worker placement pieces, occupying spaces on the board rather than simply providing favours:

**Constable Bucket** — A police inspector who can run off unsavoury guests from any player's hand or tableau (including your own, to refresh your deck).

**Mr. Higbee** — An employment agent who can immediately hire servants from the supply outside of the normal hiring mechanism.

**Reverend Grantly** — A clergyman who allows you to exchange an Objective Card you don't want for a new one from the supply.

**The Eccentric Dowager Marchioness** — Connects players with foreign nobility, introducing international prestige guests into the game.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'chars-distinguished',
    expansion: 'characters',
    title: 'Distinguished Family Members',
    content: `Each player may optionally replace 1 or 2 of their ordinary family members with Distinguished Family Members from the Characters expansion.

Distinguished Family Members have the same family crest but offer enhanced favours compared to their ordinary counterparts. They are worth more victory points and provide better abilities, but they must be selected at game setup and cannot be swapped during play.

Consider carefully which ordinary family members to replace — the base cards serve specific roles, and Distinguished replacements may shift your strategic priorities.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'chars-second-chance',
    expansion: 'characters',
    title: 'Second Chance Servants',
    content: `Second Chance Servants are staff members with personal quirks — intoxicated, flirtatious, or clumsy — who can be hired to fill servant roles in a pinch.

These servants allow you to host activities that would otherwise be impossible due to servant unavailability, but they come with consequences:
- **Intoxicated servants** cause reputation penalties
- **Flirtatious servants** cause reputation or relationship scandals
- **Clumsy servants** cause property damage (money penalties)

The strategic question is whether the activity's benefits outweigh the Second Chance Servant's penalties.`,
  },
  {
    id: 'chars-cooperative',
    expansion: 'characters',
    title: 'Cooperative Challenge',
    content: `The Characters expansion introduces a malevolent cooperative challenge: the disreputable Sneyd family has leveraged newly ill-gotten wealth in a quest to form an alliance with the Fairchilds of Alderley Hall.

Players must band together to prevent this alliance by outscoring the Sneyd AI across all victory point categories. The Sneyd family's Dynamic AI ensures different strategies and difficulty levels each game.

The 52-card objective deck (22 new objectives from Characters expansion) permanently replaces the two previous objective decks, providing greater variety in both standard and cooperative play.`,
