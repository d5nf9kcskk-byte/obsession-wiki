Over 16 rounds (or 20 in extended play), players host social activities, invite prestigious guests, renovate their country estate, and manage their domestic staff — all in pursuit of reputation and victory points.

The player with the most victory points at game end wins. Victory comes from your estate tiles, guest cards, completed objectives, servants, wealth, courtship wins, and final reputation level.`,

**Step 3 — Trigger Round Events**
Check the Round Track for special round events (Village Fair, Courtship, Builder's Holiday, National Holiday).

**Step 4 — Host Activity OR Pass**
*Host Activity:* Select one Improvement Tile from your estate that you wish to use this turn.
*Pass:* Retrieve your discard pile, reset all servants, and choose to either gain £200 or refresh the Builder's Market. You may also hire servants during a Pass.

**Step 5 — Invite Guests**
Play Gentry cards from your active hand that match the tile's guest requirements.

**Step 6 — Provide Servants**
Deploy available servants from your board to meet the tile's servant requirements.

**Step 7 — Resolve Favours**
Resolve all favour effects from the tile and guest cards (in any order). Some favours are mandatory; some are optional.

**Step 8 — Buy Improvement (Optional)**
Purchase one Improvement Tile from the Builder's Market (pay the cost in money). Exception: Builder's Holiday allows unlimited purchases.`,

**Courtship Rounds** (Rounds 4, 8, 12, 16 in standard; Rounds 5, 10, 15, 20 in extended)
No normal activities are hosted. Instead:
1. Reveal the top card of the Courtship Deck — this shows the Theme Category.
2. Each player totals the VP value of all Improvement Tiles in their estate matching that category.
3. The player with the highest total wins and chooses one of the two available Fairchild cards.
4. Each Courtship winner also draws one VP Card.
5. Tiebreaker: highest reputation. If still tied: nobody wins the Fairchild card.

**Builder's Holiday** (Round 11 in standard; Round 13 in extended)
Players may purchase as many Improvement Tiles as they can afford this round, instead of the usual limit of one.

**National Holiday** (Round 14 in standard; Round 11 in extended)
All prestige/reputation restrictions are removed this round. Players may host any activity and invite any guest, regardless of reputation requirements. This is often the most memorable turn of the game.`,

    content: `Courtship is the central competitive mechanic of Obsession. Four times per game, players compete for the favor of Mr. Charles Fairchild and Miss Elizabeth Fairchild.

**Courtship Rounds:**
The 16-round game includes Courtship rounds at Rounds 4, 8, 12, and 16 (the final round).

**How Courtship Works:**
1. A Theme Card is revealed showing a Tile Category (Essential, Service, Estate, Prestige, Sporting, or Monument)
2. Players total VP from matching tiles in their estate tableau
3. Highest total wins a Fairchild card (worth 8 VP + special favours)
4. Winner also draws a VP Card

**Open vs. Closed Courtship Variants:**
- Open (default): Theme card revealed at season start — players can strategize
- Closed (variant): Theme card revealed only during Courtship — more surprise

**Fairchild Cards:**
- Mr. Charles Fairchild: 8 VP, significant reputation boost
- Miss Elizabeth Fairchild: 8 VP, draw additional guest cards`,

    content: `After Round 16 (or 20 in extended play), players total Victory Points from all sources:

1. **Improvement Tiles** — Sum the VP shown on each tile in your estate (Level 1 or Level 2 side, whichever is face-up)
2. **Gentry Cards** — Sum the VP value of every card in your deck (hand + discard pile)
3. **Objective Cards** — Score each completed Objective Card per its instructions
4. **Servants** — 2 VP per servant on your board
5. **Wealth** — 1 VP per £200 (round down)
6. **VP Cards** — Total the VP shown on any VP Cards won during Courtship
7. **Reputation** — Scales significantly: higher reputation levels are worth exponentially more VP, with maximum reputation worth up to 45 VP

The player with the most total VP wins. In case of a tie, the player with the higher reputation wins. If still tied, the player with more money wins.`,

    content: `**Extended Play (20 Rounds)**
Deal only 4 Objective Cards per player (instead of 5). Special rounds shift slightly in positioning.

**Open Courtship (Default)**
Theme cards for each season are revealed at the start of that season, allowing players time to plan their tile purchases around upcoming Courtship themes.

**Closed Courtship**
Theme cards are only revealed during the actual Courtship round, adding more surprise and reducing long-term planning.

**Emily Brontë Market Variant**
The Builder's Market is completely reset and repopulated at the start of each new Courtship season, ensuring better tile availability throughout the game.

**Queen Victoria Market Variant**
The cheapest tile in the market is removed at the end of each round. The market gradually shifts toward more expensive and prestigious tiles.

**Solo Play**
One player competes against an AI "automa" opponent using opponent cards and a 20-sided die. The AI's card determines its actions; the player must outscore it across all VP categories.`,
